# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my Deep Learning Module Assignment 1 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of training Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification on the CIFAR100 and the MNIST-Fashion datasets

- `cifar.ipynb` contains the training and tuning code for the CIFAR100 dataset documented with markdown comments
- `fashion.ipynb` contains the training and tuning code for the MNIST-Fashion dataset documented with markdown comments
- `.html` simply contains the notebooks exported to `.html` format
